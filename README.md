# Conditional Statements Advanced - Lab

### Tasks:

01. Day of Week:

   Write a program that reads an integer entered by the user and prints the day of the week, in the range [1...7], or prints "Error" in case the entered number is invalid.

  ########

02. Weekend or Working Day:

   Write a program that reads the day of the week (text), entered by the user. If the day is working, it prints on the console - "Working day", if it is a holiday - "Weekend". If a text other than a day of the week is entered, "Error" will be printed.

########

03. Animal Type:

Write a program that reads an integer from the console and on each successive line integers until their sum is greater than or equal to the original number. After reading is complete, print the sum of the entered numbers.

########

04. Personal Titles:

Write a program that reads a number n entered by the user and prints all numbers ≤ n from the sequence: 1, 3, 7, 15, 31, …. Each subsequent number is calculated by multiplying the previous one by 2 and adding 1.

########

05. Small Shop:

Write a program that calculates how much total money is in the account after you make a certain number of deposits. On each line you will receive the amount you need to deposit into the account until you receive a "NoMoreMoney" command. For each amount received, "Increase: " + the amount must be displayed on the console and added to the account. If you get a number less than 0 the console should display "Invalid operation!"  and the program to end. When the program ends, it should print "Total: " + the total amount in the account formatted to the second decimal place.

########

06. Number in Range:

Write a program that, until the "Stop" command is received, reads integers entered by the user, finds the largest among them, and prints it. Enter one number per line.

########

07. Working Hours:

Write a program that, until the "Stop" command is received, reads integers entered by the user, finds the smallest among them, and prints it. Enter one number per line.

########

08. Cinema Ticket:

Write a program that calculates the grade point average of a student over his entire course. On the first line, you will get the student's name, and on each subsequent line, their annual grades. The student advances to the next grade if his annual grade is greater than or equal to 4.00. If the student is interrupted more than once, the student is expelled and the program ends, printing the name of the student and the class in which he was expelled.

On successful completion of 12th grade to print:

"{student name} graduated. Average grade: {the average grade of the entire study}"

In case the student is excluded from school, print:

"{student name} has been excluded at {grade in which he was excluded} grade"

The value must be formatted to the second decimal place.

01. Cinema:

In a movie theater, the chairs are arranged in a rectangular shape in r rows and c columns. There are three types of screenings with tickets at different prices:
   
   • Premiere - premiere screening, at a price of BGN 12.00;
   
   • Normal - standard projection, at a price of BGN 7.50;
   
   • Discount - screening for children, schoolchildren and students at a reduced price of BGN 5.00.
    
Write a program that reads the projection type (text), number of rows and number of columns in the hall (integers) entered by the user and calculates the total ticket revenue for a full house. Print the result in 2 decimal places format.

########

02. Summer Outfit:

Summer is a season with very changeable weather and Victor needs your help. Write a program that, based on the time of day and the degrees, recommends Victor what clothes to wear. Your friend has different plans for each stage of the day, which also require a different appearance - you can see them from the table.
Exactly two lines are read from the console:

• Degrees - whole number;
• Time of day - text with three options "Morning", "Afternoon" or "Evening".
